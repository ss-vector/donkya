						<h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">The Big Issue of Plastic</h2>
						<p class="fs-6">The first plastic was produced in the early 1900s. Now, more than 100 years later, it has become one of the biggest global problems.</p>
						<p class="fs-6">Plastic pollution grew from two million tonnes in 1950 to 348 million tonnes in 2017, making it a global industry valued at <strong>$522.6 billion</strong>, according to the Programme. It is expected to double by 2040.</p>
						<p class="fs-6">The impacts of plastic production and pollution are a looming catastrophe in the context of the triple planetary crisis of climate change, loss of nature and pollution, the UN agency said.</p>
						<p class="fs-6">Exposure to plastics harms human health, and can affect fertility, hormonal, metabolic and neurological activity, while open burning of plastics contributes to air pollution.</br>By 2050, greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, use and disposal of plastics will account for 15% of allowable emissions under the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C.</p>
